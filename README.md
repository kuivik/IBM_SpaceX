# IBM_SpaceX

SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. It is the only private company to ever take a spacecraft back from low-earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010. The SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with **a cost of 62 million dollars, whereas other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each**, much of the savings is because the Space X can reuse its **first stage**. Thus, if we can determine whether the first stage lands, we can determine the cost of take-off.

This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
